# MotherTree Resources

Welcome to the MotherTree Resources repository! This is a collection of resources that the MotherTree LS finds to be helpful to have. Everything from maps to AshitaCast templates. If you wish to contribute to this repository, feel free to create your own repository, and then reach out to council - we can add it as a submodule to link the two together.
